# File Organization Best Practices

A sensible file organization makes your notes easier to find and manage.

## Why It Matters

- **Find things quickly**: No more hunting around
- **Avoid duplicates**: Clear structure prevents redundancy
- **Mory understands better**: Structured content is easier for Mory to work with
- **Easier maintenance**: Regular cleanup becomes painless

## How to Design Your Structure

### Organize by Domain

A basic structure that works for most people:

```
Notes/
├── Work/
│   ├── Projects/
│   ├── Logs/
│   └── Summaries/
├── Study/
│   ├── Programming/
│   ├── English/
│   └── Reading/
├── Life/
│   ├── Travel/
│   ├── Health/
│   └── Finance/
└── Archive/
```

### PARA Method

For people juggling multiple projects:

```
Notes/
├── Projects/       # Active projects
│   ├── ProjectA/
│   └── ProjectB/
├── Areas/          # Long-term responsibilities
│   ├── Health/
│   ├── Finance/
│   └── Career/
├── Resources/      # Topics of interest
│   ├── Tech/
│   ├── Design/
│   └── Writing/
└── Archives/       # Completed/inactive
```

### Zettelkasten Method

For those focused on knowledge connections:

```
Notes/
├── Inbox/          # Quick capture
├── Notes/          # Permanent notes
├── Literature/     # Literature notes
└── Projects/       # Project-related
```

## Naming Conventions

### File Naming

**Recommended format:**

```
2024-01-15 Meeting Notes - Product Review.md
ProjectA-Requirements-v2.md
"Atomic Habits" Reading Notes.md
```

**Naming principles:**

| Principle | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| Date prefix | Easy chronological sorting | `2024-01-15 xxx.md` |
| Descriptive names | Know what it is at a glance | `Meeting Notes - Product Review.md` |
| Avoid special characters | Better compatibility | Don't use `/ \ : * ?` |
| Moderate length | Not too short or long | 10-30 characters |

### Folder Naming

**Recommended:**
```
Work/
Study/
2024-Projects/
```

**Avoid:**
```
New Folder/
Temp/
asdf/
```

## Content Organization

### Use Templates

Create templates for common note types:

**Daily log template:**
```markdown
# {{date}}

## What I Did Today
-

## In Progress
-

## Tomorrow's Plan
-

## Random Thoughts
```

**Meeting notes template:**
```markdown
# {{meeting topic}}

**Date**:
**Attendees**:
**Meeting Goal**:

## Discussion Points
-

## Decisions
-

## Action Items
| Task | Owner | Due Date |
|------|-------|----------|
|      |       |          |
```

### Use Heading Levels Well

Use headings to make structure clear:

```markdown
# Level 1 (Document Topic)

## Level 2 (Main Sections)

### Level 3 (Subsections)

Body content...
```

### Link Related Notes

Build connections between notes:

```markdown
This idea came from [[Book Notes - Atomic Habits]],
and relates to [[Time Management Methods]].
```

## Regular Maintenance

### Daily: Process Inbox

- Move quick captures to proper locations
- Flesh out temporary notes

### Weekly: Review and Archive

- Check this week's notes
- Archive completed projects
- Delete what's not needed

### Monthly: Optimize Structure

- Review overall folder structure
- Merge similar content
- Update indexes

## Let Mory Help Organize

### Auto-categorize

```
Help me sort the notes in my Inbox folder into appropriate locations
```

### Find Duplicates

```
Check if there's any duplicate or similar content in my notes
```

### Generate Index

```
Help me create an index of my notes
```

### Cleanup Suggestions

```
Find notes that haven't been updated in 6 months, see if they should be archived
```

## Common Issues

### Folder Hierarchy Too Deep

**Problem**: More than 3-4 levels deep, hard to find things

**Solution**:
- Flatten the structure
- Use naming instead of nesting
- Use search instead of browsing

### Don't Know Which Folder

**Problem**: Decision paralysis on categorization

**Solution**:
- Put in Inbox first, organize later
- Create a "To Sort" folder
- Rely on search instead of precise categorization

### Historical Notes Are a Mess

**Problem**: Old notes were never organized

**Solution**:
- Don't try to fix everything at once
- Organize as you use them
- Have Mory help with batch processing

## Pro Tips

### Search Is King

Don't rely too much on folder browsing, use search:

- MoryFlow's built-in search
- Ask Mory with natural language
- Use tags as helpers

### Progressive Organization

Don't aim for perfection, let organization evolve with your needs:

1. Capture quickly first
2. Organize when you have time
3. Optimize structure periodically
