# Prompt Tips

Good prompts help Mory understand what you want and give you better responses.

## Basic Principles

### 1. Be Specific

**Not ideal:**
```
Help me write a summary
```

**Better:**
```
Help me summarize the "project-plan.md" note,
focusing on: goals, milestones, and owners,
in table format, under 200 words.
```

### 2. Give Context

**Not ideal:**
```
Give me some suggestions
```

**Better:**
```
I'm preparing for my English exam next week,
I've reviewed vocabulary and grammar,
but listening is my weak spot.
Give me some suggestions for improving listening.
```

### 3. Specify the Format You Want

**Examples:**
```
Output in Markdown format
```

```
List it in a table
```

```
Bullet points, each under 50 words
```

```
Generate a note I can save directly
```

## Getting Mory to Read Your Notes

### Read Specific Files

```

## Getting Mory to Create Content

organized like this:

```

goal is to learn Python basics.

## Advanced Techniques

### Role Playing

```

```

### Chain of Thought

Help me analyze this problem,
first list all possible causes,
then eliminate them one by one,
finally give me a conclusion.
```

### Multi-round Iteration

```
Help me write an outline for a project proposal
```

Round 2:
```
Outline looks good, help me expand section 2
```

### Format Templates

```

```

## What to Avoid

### Don't Be Too Vague

❌ `Help me write something`

✅ `Help me write a 500-word product intro highlighting three key features`

### Don't Assume Mory Knows the Context

❌ `Continue from last time`

✅ `Last time we discussed Project A requirements, please continue helping me flesh out the technical solution`

### Don't Ask for Too Many Things at Once

❌ `Help me write a proposal, make a table, send an email, schedule a meeting`

✅ Take it step by step, focus on one thing at a time

## Keep Improving

1. **Save good prompts**: Record ones that work well for reuse
2. **Analyze failed conversations**: When Mory misunderstands, think about what wasn't clear
3. **Try different phrasings**: Same request, different wording might work better
