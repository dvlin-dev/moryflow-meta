# Multi-device Sync

MoryFlow notes are just regular folders—use cloud storage to sync across devices.

## How It Works

MoryFlow notes are **regular Markdown files** stored in a folder you specify.

Just put that folder in a cloud sync directory and it automatically syncs to other devices.

```
Cloud Sync Folder/
└── My Notes/     ← This is your notes folder
    ├── Work/
    ├── Study/
    └── ...
```

   ```

2. Or use a custom path in iCloud Drive

3. Select this directory as your notes folder in MoryFlow

**Pros:**
- Seamless Apple ecosystem integration
- Stable and fast sync

**Notes:**
- Large files may sync slowly
- Make sure you have enough iCloud space

### Windows: OneDrive

1. Put your notes folder in OneDrive:
   ```
   C:\Users\YourName\OneDrive\My Notes
   ```

2. Select this directory in MoryFlow

**Pros:**
- Native Windows integration
- Works well with Office

### Cross-platform: Dropbox

**How to set up:**

1. Install Dropbox client
2. Put your notes folder in Dropbox directory
3. Select this directory in MoryFlow

**Pros:**
- Cross-platform support
- Reliable sync

**Notes:**

### Cross-platform: Other Cloud Services

Similar setup process:

1. Install cloud service client
2. Put notes folder in sync directory
3. Select in MoryFlow

**Common services:**
- Google Drive
- pCloud
- Syncthing (P2P)

## Sync Best Practices

### Avoiding Conflicts

Editing the same file on multiple devices simultaneously can cause conflicts.

**How to prevent:**

1. **Wait for sync before editing**
   - After opening MoryFlow, wait a few seconds for files to sync

2. **Don't edit simultaneously**
   - Finish editing on one device, wait for sync, then edit on another

3. **Edit different files**
   - On different devices, work on different notes

### When Conflicts Happen

When there's a conflict, cloud storage typically:
- Keeps both versions
- Creates a copy marked "conflict"

**How to resolve:**
1. Compare the content of both files
2. Manually merge what you need
3. Delete the conflict copy

## Things to Note

### First Time Sync

When setting up, wait for all files to sync before starting to use.

### Large Number of Files

If you have many or large files:
- First sync may take a while
- Use selective sync to exclude what you don't need

### Attachments

If notes have images or other attachments:
- Make sure attachments are in the sync scope
- Large attachments may slow down sync

### Configuration Files

MoryFlow settings (API keys, etc.) are stored in the app data directory and **won't** sync with your notes folder.

Each device needs separate configuration:
- API Keys
- Theme settings
- Other preferences

| Google Drive | All | Generous space | May need special access |

## Advanced Solutions

### Git Sync

If you know Git, you can use it to manage notes:

**Pros:**

```

### Syncthing

Decentralized sync solution:

- No cloud service dependency
- Direct device-to-device sync
- Full control over your data

Good for: Users with very high privacy requirements

## Common Issues

### Files Disappeared After Sync

1. Check cloud service's trash
2. Look for sync errors
3. Check if other devices have a copy

### Slow Sync Speed

1. Check network connection
2. Exclude large files
3. Reduce file count

### File In Use Error

1. Make sure MoryFlow isn't open with the same folder on another device
2. Wait for sync to complete before operating
