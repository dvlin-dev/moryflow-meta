# Mory's Tools

Mory isn't just for chatting—it has a bunch of tools that help it do real work for you.

## File Operations

### Read Files

```
Help me see what's in "Work/project-plan.md"
```

### Write Files

```
Help me create a new note called "Today's Thoughts"
```

Automatically creates needed folders, won't overwrite existing files without asking.

### Edit Files

```
Add a table of contents at the beginning of this note
```

### See What's in a Folder

```
What notes are in my "Work" folder?
```

### Search Files

```
Find all notes starting with "Meeting"
```

```
Search my notes for any that mention "machine learning"
```

### Move Files

```
Move "temp-note.md" to the "Archive" folder
```

### Delete

```
Delete "draft.md"
```

Deleted files go to trash—you can recover them if needed.

## Web Access

### Search for Information

```
Search for notable AI news in 2024
```

### Fetch Web Pages

```
Help me read this webpage: https://example.com/article
```

Great for grabbing good articles from the web and saving them to notes.

## Run Commands

```
Run npm install
```

:::tip No worries
Mory tells you what command it's about to run, and asks before doing anything risky.

## Make Plans

For complex tasks, Mory breaks them into smaller steps:

```
Help me create a two-week study plan
```

It lists out the tasks, executes them one by one, and tracks progress.

## See What It's Doing

When Mory uses tools, you can see the whole process:

<!-- Screenshot placeholder: tool call details -->

1. First it explains why it's using this tool
2. Then shows the specific operation
3. Finally tells you the result

Everything is out in the open.

## It Combines Tools

For example, if you say "help me prepare for an exam," Mory might:

1. First read your study notes
2. Search the web for latest exam topics
3. Combine them to write a review plan
4. Save it as a new note

No need to direct each step—it figures things out on its own.

## Want More Capabilities?

You can add skills to Mory through MCP—like letting it work with GitHub, control a browser, and more.
