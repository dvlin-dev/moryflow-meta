# MCP Extensions

Want to give Mory new skills? That's what MCP is for.

## What is MCP

MCP is a protocol that lets Mory connect to various external tools. Like installing plugins.

For example, install the GitHub MCP and Mory can search repos, view Issues, and create PRs.

## How to Configure

1. Open Settings (gear icon, top right)
2. Click the "MCP" tab

<!-- Screenshot placeholder: MCP settings -->
![MCP Settings](/images/settings/mcp-settings.png)

3. Click "Add Server"
4. Fill in the info:
   - Name: whatever you want
   - Command: how to start it (usually `npx`)
   - Args: startup arguments
   - Environment variables: like API keys

### Example: Adding GitHub

```json
{
  "name": "github",
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
  "env": {
    "GITHUB_TOKEN": "your-token-here"
  }
}
```

## How to Use

Once configured, Mory can automatically use the new tools.

```
You: Search GitHub for MoryFlow-related repos
Mory: [Using GitHub search]
      Found these repos...
```

## Management

- Each MCP can be toggled on/off individually
- Click edit button to change configuration
- Delete if you don't want it anymore

## Troubleshooting

**Won't start**
- Check if the command is correct
- Make sure Node.js is installed
- Check environment variables

**Not working**
- Look at what error it shows
- Is the API key still valid?
- Is the network working?

## Build Your Own

If you can code, you can write your own MCP server.

Check the [official MCP documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) to learn how.
