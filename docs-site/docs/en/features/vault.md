# Notes Folder

All your notes are stored in this folder.

## Just a Regular Folder

MoryFlow notes aren't some special format—just regular Markdown files stored in a folder you choose.

This means:

- Open them with VS Code, Typora, or Notepad
- If you stop using MoryFlow someday, your notes are still yours
- Want to migrate to another app? Just copy them over
- Want to use Git for version control? Absolutely

## The File List on the Left

Open MoryFlow and the left side shows your folder structure.
