# Your First Chat

Now let's try MoryFlow's core feature—Mory, your AI assistant.

## Set Up AI First

Before chatting, you need to tell MoryFlow which AI service to use.

### Recommended: OpenRouter

[OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) is an AI service aggregator—one account, access to many models. Pretty convenient.

1. Sign up at [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai)
2. Create an API Key in the Dashboard
3. Open MoryFlow settings (gear icon, top right)
4. Find "Model Management"
5. Paste your API Key in the OpenRouter field

Recommended:
- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet**: Well-rounded, great for everyday use
- **GPT-4o**: Fast responses
- **DeepSeek V3**: Affordable, great for many languages

## Start Chatting

Type in the input box on the right, hit Enter to send.

### Try These

**Ask anything:**
```
What is Markdown?
```

**Have Mory look at your notes:**
```
Check out the note I just wrote and summarize it
```

**Have it write something:**
```
Help me write a note about time management
```

**Have it search the web:**
```
Search for some good movies released recently
```

## What Mory Can Do

It's not just chat—it can:

**Read and write your notes**
- View note contents
- Help write new notes
- Search across all your notes
- Help organize and move files

**Search the web**
- Find the latest information
- Fetch webpage content

**Execute tasks**
- Run certain commands
- Break down complex tasks and work through them step by step

## See What It's Doing

When Mory works, you can see its "thought process"—which files it read, what it searched, what changes it made.
