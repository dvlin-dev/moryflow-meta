# Create Your First Note

After choosing your folder, you're in the main interface. Let's write something.

## Create a New Note

A few ways to do this:

**Click the button**
1. At the top of the file list on the left, there's a **+** button
2. Click it, choose "New Note"
3. Type a name, hit Enter

**Right-click menu**

Right-click in the empty space on the left → New Note → type a name

**Keyboard shortcut**

- Mac: `⌘ + N`
- Windows: `Ctrl + N`

## Start Writing

Once your note is created, just start typing in the editor area.

### Slash Commands

Type `/` to bring up a quick menu for inserting things:

| Type | Inserts |
|------|---------|
| `/h1` `/h2` `/h3` | Headings |
| `/bullet` | Bullet list |
| `/todo` | To-do checklist |
| `/code` | Code block |
| `/table` | Table |

### Markdown Syntax

If you know Markdown, just type it directly:

```markdown
# Big heading
## Smaller heading
- List item
- [ ] To-do item
> Quote
**bold** *italic*
```

### When You Select Text

Select some text and a small toolbar appears—quickly make it bold, italic, change color, etc.

The top right shows save status:
- ✓ Saved
- ○ Saving
- ✗ Error

Right-click in the empty space on the left → New Folder
