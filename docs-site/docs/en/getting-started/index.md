# What is MoryFlow

MoryFlow is a note-taking app with a built-in AI assistant called **Mory**.

It's not just another chatbot that forgets everything between conversations—it's a **companion** that reads your notes, remembers what you've said, and actually helps you get things done.

## How It's Different

### It Remembers

Regular AI assistants are "amnesiac"—you have to keep telling them who you are and what you want.

Mory is different. It reads your notes and knows what you're working on and what you like. **The more you chat, the better it understands you**.

### Notes Stay on Your Computer

Everything you write is just regular files, stored in a folder on your own computer:

- Nothing uploaded to any server
- Works offline
- Want to sync? Just put the folder in your cloud drive
- If you ever stop using MoryFlow, your notes are still yours

### Actually Gets Things Done

Mory isn't just for chatting. It can:

- Read your notes, help organize and summarize them
- Search the web for useful information
- Help you write and make plans
- Break down complex tasks into small steps and work through them

## What It Looks Like

Open MoryFlow and you'll see three panels:

| Position | What it's for |
|----------|---------------|
| **Left** | Your notes folder—all your notes are here |
| **Center** | Editor—where you write |
| **Right** | Mory—chat with it anytime |
