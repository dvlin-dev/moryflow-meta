First look at last year's records, then search for creative ideas.
```

**Mory will:**
```
OK, let me see how last year went...

[Reading] Work/Event-planning/2023-annual-party.md

Based on last year's feedback and current trends:

## Areas to Improve

   - Live voting
   - Team challenge games
   - Memory wall
3. **Surprise elements**:

### Over Budget?

**You say:**
```
Looks good! But might be over budget, where can we cut?
```

**Mory will:**
```
OK, let me see where we can trim:

## Cost-Saving Ideas

### 1. Venue (save $500-800)
- Choose a weekday: 20% cheaper than weekends
- Afternoon session: cheaper than evening
- Bring some decorations: reduce venue setup fee

### 2. Decorations (save $300-500)
- Buy vs rent decorations
- Have employees make DIY decorations
- Share accessories at photo booth instead of giving to everyone

### 3. Catering (save $800)
- Buffet style: $32/person
- Basic beverages only

### Optimized Budget
| Item | Original | Optimized |
|------|----------|-----------|
| Venue | $3,000 | $2,400 |
| Catering | $4,000 | $3,200 |
| Decorations | $1,500 | $1,000 |
| Prizes | $1,000 | $1,000 |
| Contingency | $500 | $500 |
| **Total** | **$10,000** | **$8,100** |

This saves about $1,900 as buffer. How does that look?
```

## More Tips

### Generate Timeline

```
Convert the event flow into a Gantt chart format timeline
```

### Generate Shopping List

```
Based on the proposal, generate a detailed shopping list with reference links
```

### Post-Event Template

```
After the event, help me generate a retrospective template
```
