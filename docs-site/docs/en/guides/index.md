## Some Universal Tips First

### 1. Accumulate First, Leverage Later

Mory's abilities build on your notes. The more you record, the more it can help you with.

**Suggestions:**
- Build a habit of quick notes
- Doesn't have to be perfect—even just keywords work
- Mory can help you organize later

### 2. Be Clear About What You Want

Tell Mory:
- What you're trying to do
- What format you want
- Any special requirements

**Example:**
```
Help me prepare for my English exam next week.
Requirements:
1. Look at my previous study notes
2. Focus on grammar
3. Give me a daily review plan
4. Preferably in a table
```

### 3. Break Down Complex Tasks

```
First help me see what topics are in my notes
```

```
OK, for the "time management" topic, help me summarize the key points
```

```
Finally generate a summary and save it as a new note
```

### 4. Keep Iterating If It's Not Right

Mory's first output might not be perfect—that's fine, keep the conversation going:

```
This plan looks good, but can week 2 be more compact?
```

```
Change the times in the table to specific dates
```
