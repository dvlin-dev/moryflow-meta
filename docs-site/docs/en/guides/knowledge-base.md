# Building Your Knowledge Base

Use MoryFlow to build your "second brain"—make your knowledge accumulation compound over time.

## Why Use MoryFlow for Knowledge Management

### Problems with Traditional Knowledge Bases

- **Saved = Forgotten**: Bookmarked tons of articles, never looked at them again
- **Scattered everywhere**: Knowledge in bits and pieces, no connections
- **Can't find it**: Can't locate things when you need them
- **Not digested**: Saved as-is, never made it your own

### How MoryFlow Helps

- **Mory organizes for you**: Auto-summarize, categorize, connect
- **Natural language search**: Don't need to remember keywords, just ask
- **Knowledge activation**: Mory can answer questions based on your knowledge base
- **Gets smarter over time**: More notes = Mory understands you better

## How to Organize Your Knowledge Base

### Recommended Structure

```

```

### PARA Method (Optional)

If you prefer the PARA method:

```
Knowledge/
├── Projects/      # Current projects
├── Areas/         # Long-term focus areas
├── Resources/     # Topics of interest
└── Archives/      # Completed/inactive
```

## Knowledge Input

### 1. Article Excerpts

When you find a good article, capture the key points:

```markdown
# "How to Learn Effectively" Excerpt

**Source**: https://example.com/article
**Date**: 2024-01-15
**Tags**: #learning #productivity

## Core Ideas
1. Active learning is 5x more effective than passive learning
2. Spaced repetition is key to memory
3. Teaching others is the best way to learn

## My Thoughts
This aligns with the Feynman technique...

## Action Items
- [ ] Use Feynman technique to learn XXX
```

### 2. Book Notes

```markdown
# "Book Title" Reading Notes

**Author**: XXX
**Finished**: 2024-01
**Rating**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

## One-Sentence Summary
This book is about...

## Chapter Highlights
### Chapter 1: XXX
- Key point 1
- Key point 2

## Memorable Quotes
> "Quote from the book..."

## Action Items After Reading
- [ ] Try the method from the book
```

## Knowledge Processing

### Let Mory Help Organize

**You say:**
```
Help me organize content about "learning methods" from my "Knowledge/Input" folder,
and create a topic note.
```

**Mory will:**
```
[Searching] Knowledge/Input/**/*.md containing "learning"
[Reading] (matched files)

Based on your materials, here's a learning methods topic note:

---

# Learning Methodology

## Core Principles

### 1. Active Learning > Passive Learning
- **Source**: "How to Learn Effectively"
- **Key point**: Active thinking, questioning, practice—5x efficiency boost
- **How to apply**: Try explaining to others after learning

### 2. Spaced Repetition
- **Source**: "Make It Stick", Anki method
- **Key point**: Forgetting curve, regular review
- **How to apply**: Use Anki or regularly revisit notes

### 3. Feynman Technique
- **Source**: Feynman, "How to Learn Effectively"
- **Steps**:
  1. Choose a concept
  2. Explain in simple terms
  3. Identify gaps in understanding
  4. Simplify and use analogies

## My Action List
- [ ] Organize learning notes weekly
- [ ] Use Feynman technique for new topics
- [ ] Build personal Anki card deck

---

Save to "Knowledge/Processing/Topic-notes/"?
```

### Concept Cards

Turn important concepts into cards:

```markdown
# Feynman Technique

**What is it**
Learn by "teaching others"—ensures true understanding.

**How to do it**
1. Pick a concept to learn
2. Pretend to teach a child
3. Find where you can't explain clearly
4. Go back and study until you can explain simply

**Related Concepts**
- Active learning
- Knowledge internalization
- Learning by teaching

**When to use**
- Learning new technologies
- Preparing presentations
- Testing if you really understand
```

## Knowledge Retrieval

### Natural Language Search

No need to remember keywords, just ask:

```
I read an article about learning methods that mentioned something about 5x efficiency, help me find it
```

```
What notes do I have about project management?
```

### Knowledge Q&A

Get answers based on your knowledge base:

```
Based on my learning notes, summarize the three core principles of effective learning
```

```
I want to learn a new skill, based on my previous notes, what suggestions do you have?
```

## Knowledge Output

### Write Blog Posts

```
Based on my notes about "learning methods", help me write a blog post
titled "3 Effective Learning Methods I Practice"
```

### Create Presentations

```
I'm giving a talk about time management, help me create a PPT outline based on related notes
```

### Knowledge Map

```
Help me create an index of my knowledge base, listing all topics and key notes
```

## Knowledge Base Maintenance

### Regular Cleanup

Suggest spending 30 minutes weekly organizing:

```
Help me see what notes were added this week, what needs organizing or connecting
```

### Find Orphans

```
Help me find "isolated" notes in my knowledge base—ones not referenced by other notes
```

### Clear Outdated Content

```
Help me find notes not updated for over a year, I'll decide whether to archive them
```

## Key Takeaways

### 1. Lower the Input Barrier
- Don't aim for perfect, just capture first
- Use templates to reduce thinking overhead
- Quick capture in spare moments

### 2. Process Regularly
- Raw materials → Topic notes → Concept cards
- Organize weekly, don't let it pile up
- Mory helps, but add your own thinking

### 3. Output Actively
- Output is the best learning
- Sharing forces you to organize
- Knowledge is only valuable when used

### 4. Keep Iterating
- Knowledge base is alive, needs continuous updates
- Regular review and revision
- Delete what's outdated
