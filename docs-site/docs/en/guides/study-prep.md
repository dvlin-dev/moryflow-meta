First look at my English study notes to see where I'm at.
```

**Mory will:**
```
OK, let me check your notes...

[Reading] Study/English/Vocabulary.md
[Reading] Study/English/Grammar.md
[Reading] Study/English/Listening-practice.md

From what I can see:
- You've accumulated about 500 vocabulary words
- Tense grammar looks solid, but fewer notes on clauses
- Not many listening practice records

Here's a 30-day plan:

| Week | Focus | Daily tasks |
|------|-------|------------|
| Week 1 | Vocabulary | Review 50 old words, learn 30 new |
| Week 2 | Grammar | Focus on clauses, daily grammar exercises |
| Week 3 | Listening | 30 minutes of listening practice daily |
| Week 4 | Comprehensive | Practice tests, fill gaps |
