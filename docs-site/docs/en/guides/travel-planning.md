### Finding Accommodation

**You say:**
```
Search for Kyoto accommodation recommendations that fit my budget and preferences
```

**Mory will:**
```
[Web search] Kyoto hotels $80-120 convenient location

Based on your requirements ($80-120/night, convenient transport, breakfast), here are my recommendations:

## Recommended Areas

### 1. Shijo Kawaramachi (Top Pick)
- Pros: City center, transport hub, great for dining and shopping
- Cons: Slightly noisy
- Recommended:
  - Mitsui Garden Hotel Shijo (~$110)
  - Hotel Gracery Kyoto (~$95)

### 2. Kyoto Station Area
- Pros: Best transport, close to Arashiyama/Nara
- Cons: Commercial, less Kyoto atmosphere
- Recommended:
  - Daiwa Roynet Hotel (~$90)
  - Hotel Keihan Kyoto (~$85)

### 3. Gion/Higashiyama
- Pros: Most Kyoto atmosphere, near attractions
- Cons: Slightly pricier
- Recommended:
  - Hotel The Celestine Kyoto Gion (~$120)

## My Suggestion
Given your itinerary (Higashiyama, Arashiyama, Fushimi), I'd recommend **Shijo Kawaramachi**—central location, and you can walk to Pontocho and Nishiki Market at night.
