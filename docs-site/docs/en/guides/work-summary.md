# Work Summaries with MoryFlow

Let Mory transform your daily work logs into professional summaries.

## When to Use This

You need to write work summaries (weekly, monthly, annual) and want to:

- Not miss important work items
- Clear structure, highlighted key points
- Quickly generate professional formats

## Preparation

### 1. Build a Logging Habit

During work, jot things down. Doesn't need to be complete—just keywords are fine.

**Work directory structure:**
```

│   ├── 2024-01-16.md
│   └── ...
├── Projects/
│   ├── ProjectA/
│   └── ProjectB/
└── Summaries/
    ├── Weekly/
    └── Monthly/
```

### 2. Daily Log Template

**Example log (2024-01-15.md):**
```markdown
# 2024-01-15 Monday

## What I Did Today
- Completed code review for user management module
- Fixed 3 bugs (#123, #124, #125)
