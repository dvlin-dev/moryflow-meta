## Follow System

With "Follow System" selected, MoryFlow automatically matches your system's theme:

### Auto Switching

If your system is set to switch to dark mode at sunset, MoryFlow will switch too.

## Editor Changes Too

Code highlighting in the editor also adapts to the theme:

- Light theme: Bright code colors
- Dark theme: Softer code colors

## Common Questions

### Some Areas Didn't Change After Switching

Restart the app and it should be fine.

### Want More Themes

Currently only light and dark are supported. More may be added in the future.

### Eye Strain Protection

MoryFlow's dark theme is already optimized for eye comfort:
- Avoids pure black backgrounds
- Moderate text contrast
- Reduced blue light

For stronger eye protection, combine with your system's Night Shift (macOS) or Night Mode (Windows).
